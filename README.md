# ðŸ”® [1.17-1.20] Break Budding Amethyst

BBA is a Minecraft plugin that allows you to break budding amethyst. By default you can't. You can break them using the enchantment skill touch on a pickaxe with the permission **bba.silk** and without silk touch with the permission **bba.break**.
You can also disable permissions in plugin's configuration. By default, players who are server operators can run the /bba reload command. However, you can also assign the **bba.admin** permission.
